# RL-JAX

Implementation of interesting Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using JAX based libraries (flax, haiku and rlax)
As of now tasks come from OpenAI gym

## Current implementations

- [x] [DQN](DQN/README.md)
- [] DDPG
- [] VPG
- [ ] PPO
- [ ] A2C/A3C
- [ ] TD3

## Run

All algorithms have been implemented in jupyter notebooks, to run them type:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

And open the chosen file
